## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do these challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and (sometimes) JavaScript.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Practice using version control by creating your own Github repo for this challenge. This has the added benefit of being able to publish it on the `gh-pages` branch at the end.

Also, you could try building this project in a team. This is a great way to practice collaborative coding.

## Sharing your solution

If you decide to push the project live, tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor). Mention **@frontendmentor** and include the URL in the tweet. I'd love to take a look at what you've built!

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful to practice on.

## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any on this challenge please email me at matt[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
